# Tanooki File Manager

*Tanooki File Manager* is a fork of [Tibor Kaputa](https://github.com/tibbi)'s [Simple File Manager](https://github.com/SimpleMobileTools/Simple-File-Manager) and [Simple Commons](https://github.com/SimpleMobileTools/Simple-Commons) from his awesome [Simple Mobile Tools](https://www.simplemobiletools.com/). Almost all code was written by him. I accept donations, but pleaser consider donating to him as well.

Aims to bring features Linux users are used to from their desktop experience to Android.

This will stay as close to the awesome upstream **Simple File Manager** as possible, adding only some nice features:

+ adding and respecting `.hidden` for hiding files and directories without renaming and breaking paths,
  - thereby changing the `Hide this file` feature from adding `.` to a file name to adding the file/folder name to a `.hidden` file 
+ creating symbolic links (`ln -s`)

Can also be used for browsing root files and SD card content. You can easily rename, copy, move, delete and share anything you wish.

The fingerprint permission is needed for locking either hidden item visibility, or the whole app.

Contains no ads or unnecessary permissions. It is fully opensource, provides customizable colors.
